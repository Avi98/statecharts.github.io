[Constructing the User Interface with Statecharts](https://books.google.no/books/about/Constructing_the_User_Interface_with_Sta.html?id=-9VQAAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y&hl=en), Ian Horrocks, 1999

[Practical Statecharts in C/C++](https://www.state-machine.com/psicc/) — discusses some of the same things that Ian Horrocks’ book discusses. The book is freely available as a PDF download.

## Software

[SCA](https://github.com/JPLOpenSource/SCA) the Statechart Autocoder used by Curiosity, by JPL.  Generates C code from Magicdraw drawings of statecharts

[Yakindu Statechart Tools](https://www.itemis.com/en/yakindu/state-machine/), also [on GitHub](https://github.com/Yakindu/statecharts/). User interface and code generation tool (?)

## Libraries

[Commons SCXML](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-scxml/) by Apache, a Java implementation of an SCXML parser and runner.

[React Automata](https://github.com/MicheleBertoli/react-automata) by Michele Bertoli, a state machine abstraction for React

[SCION](https://github.com/jbeard4/SCION), [SCION-CORE](https://github.com/jbeard4/SCION-CORE) et al, by Jacob Beard.  An SCXML parser and runner in JavaScript.

[xstate](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate/), by David Khourshid, pure functional statecharts, in TypeScript

## Reference Material

[Designing Statecharts](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSB2MU_8.3.0/com.ibm.rhp.uml.diagrams.doc/topics/rhp_c_dm_designing_stchrts.html) from the IBM Rational Rhapsody. It describes all of the concepts albeit in how they are used in that application.

[Guidelines for modeling statecharts](http://sce.uhcl.edu/helm/rationalunifiedprocess/process/modguide/md_stadm.htm) in the Rational Unified Process.  Includes a good section on _Hints and Tips_ on creating statecharts!
