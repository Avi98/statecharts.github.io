# Page not found

I'm sorry, but the page you were looking for did not exist.

You could try googling what you're looking for, or check out these great pages instead:

- [What is a statechart?]()

- How do I use a statechart?

Please take your time to look through the glossary if there's any concept you're unclear about:

<ul>
{% for item in site.glossary %}
   <li><a href="{{ item.url }}">{{ item.title }}</a> â€” {{ item.oneliner }}</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
