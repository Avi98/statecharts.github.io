title: Are statecharts worth adding another library?

# Using statecharts increases the number of librariesâ€”is it worth it?

Anecdotal evidence indicates that it does: The benefits of a [correctly functioning](../benefit-low-bug-count.html) and [maintainable](../benefit-maintainability.html) codebase outweighs the relatively small size of the added libraries.  Writing programs in a bottom-up approach, adding variables to a component to know "what is happening" almost always results in software that not only is buggy, but is difficult to change.
