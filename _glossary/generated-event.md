# Generated Event

A generated event is a type of [event](event.html){:.glossary} that is caused by the handling of another event.  In other words, while processing one event, things happen in the statechart that cause the statechart to _generate_ a new event and have that new event processed by the statechart.

There are two types of generated events:

* [Raised events](raised-event.html){:.glossary}, where the author of the statechart specifies that a named event should be generated
* [Internal events](internal-event.html){:.glossary}, where the statechart itself generates events automatically when transitions occur.
