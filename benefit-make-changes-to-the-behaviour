## Easy to change the behaviour

Since the behaviour of a component is extracted into the statechart, it is relatively easy to make rather big changes to the behaviour of the component, compared to a component where the behaviour is embedded alongside the business logic.

For example by adding a small delay between actions and the events, but only in certain states.

Completely changing the behaviour so that actions are performed more or less at random makes little sense other than to battle-test the business logic's ability to expect the unexpected, basically _how defensively was the code written_.

But if a statechart has grown and become too difficult, it is much easier to rewrite the statechart from scratch to try to end up with a simpler overall solution.
