# Easy to understand

Once a developer gets past the initial hurdle of understanding statecharts, understanding a component whose behaviour is encoded in a statechart is a lot easier.

When trying to understand imperative code, you have no choice but to dive into the code, which is a mix of behaviour and side effects, structured in various ways.

When trying to understand a statechart based component, you have the choice of looking at a statechart, or a representation thereof, to understand the behaviour in isolation.  You can look at the remaining code (the guards and actions) to understand how each of them works too.  Put simply: There is a _way_ to understand statechart based code.

NASA's JPL said that it was "easier to show a statechart to a systems engineer, than a bunch of C code" and that helped people that "haven't been with the [...] project throughout the cycle"

> Code reviews for the modules constructed using a bottom-up approach were difficult and time consuming. Design and code reviews of the statechart modules were quick and effective because the software could be understood by reviewers.
