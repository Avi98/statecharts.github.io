# Non-developers can understand statecharts

Statecharts, being inherently a visual tool, is a great communication tool between the code and various stakeholders that have a need to understand the behaviour of the code.  The techniques described in [Easier to understand](benefit-easy-to-understand.html) apply just as much to non-developers too.

* Designers can use the statechart to determine which states need which type of UI 
* QA personell can [use the statecharts as an exploratory tool](benefit-qa-exploration-tool.html)
* Project owners can look at statecharts to understand its behaviour and verify that requirements are met
