## Welcome to the (unfinished) world of Statecharts

What is a statechart?

A statechart can be explained in many ways, and we'll get to those explanations, but essentially, a statechart is a drawing.  Here's a simple statechart:

However, this drawing might not be so useful for software engineers who want to reap the benefits outlined elsewhere on this site, so let's dive into some other ways of describing what a statechart is.  The original paper that defines statecharts bills them as "A visual formalism for complex systems" (Harel, 1987).  With that out of the way, let's try to explain statecharts.

### Introduction to statecharts

A statechart is simply a beefed up [state machine](what-is-a-state-machine.html).  The beefing up solves a lot of the problems that state machines have, especially [state explosion](state-machine-state-explosion.html).  One of the goals of this site is to help explain what statecharts are and how they are useful.

### Usefulness of statecharts

The concepts of statecharts and how they function can be applied to many programming disciplines.  They don't fit all problem spaces, but when the system in question reacts to events, and has a different _behaviour_ depending on previous events, then a statechart might be a good fit.
