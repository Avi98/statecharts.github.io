## Quality Assurance can use Statecharts to help with exploratory testing

A Quality Assurance process often involves a phase called _exploratory testing_, and it involves a user of a component trying it out in various ways, looking for problems. When the tester is shown a graphical representation of the behaviour (the statechart) of the component in question, it can function as a map of the behaviour; a map that can be traversed.  Any state in such a statechart should be accessible, and the tester can understand from the statechart how to arrive at various states.
